# Dual Subtitles for YouTube™

**Watch in two languages at once — the original and your translation in one clean, non‑overlapping layer that switches sentence by sentence.**

<sub>A clean‑room, open‑source <b>Manifest V3</b> extension. It reads the video's real caption track, translates it, and renders both languages in one tidy overlay you can fully style and drag.</sub>

</div>

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No analytics, no tracking, no accounts.** Caption text is sent *only* to the translation service in use — YouTube's own or Google Translate by default, or the provider you supply a key for — to be translated. Settings live in `chrome.storage.sync`; an API key you add is kept in `chrome.storage.local` on that machine only, is never synced, and goes nowhere but the provider you chose. Nothing else leaves your browser.

## ✨ What you get

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

- **Dual subtitles, one layer** — original on one line, your language on the other. YouTube's own caption layer is hidden, so the two don't collide.
- **Whole sentences** — renders from the timed caption *cues* rather than the rolling on‑screen text, so a line changes when the sentence does.
- **Two free engines, smart default** — YouTube's own whole‑track translation whenever the video supports it, with a much smarter fallback: fragmented captions are **rebuilt into full sentences** before Google translates them, so ASR fragments stop reading like word salad. Prefetched ahead of playback.
- **Or bring your own API key** — twelve providers, including DeepSeek, Gemini, DeepL and Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Each sentence is understood as a whole and then split back across the cues, so the translation line turns over with the original instead of standing still. The key is stored on your own machine and is sent to nobody but the provider you picked.
- **50 target languages**, and you choose which of them appear in the menu.

</td>
<td valign="top">

- **Fully customizable** — per‑line font, size, text colour, background colour + opacity, outline, line spacing, and which line sits on top. Live preview in the popup.
- **Draggable** — drop the subtitle box anywhere on the video; it persists, double‑click to reset. Works in fullscreen.
- **Works on Shorts** — bilingual subtitles on the vertical player too, keeping up as you swipe.
- **One‑click toggle** — a button right in the player's control bar turns everything on/off (and YouTube's CC with it).
- **Export to SRT** — download the current video's subtitles as `.srt`: original, translation, or bilingual. With your own key it can translate the whole track, and it tells you how many requests that will take before it starts.
- **Robust by design** — survives SPA navigation, falls back to reading the on‑screen caption text if the cue fetch ever fails, and turns YouTube captions on for you automatically.

## 🚀 Install

**[➜ Install from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dual-subtitles-for-youtub/ndifcigakimmibkgeabchfaolhjpcmge)** — one click, and it auto‑updates.

Then open any YouTube video with captions: the dual subtitles appear automatically (the extension turns captions on for you).

Works on **Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers**, version 111+ (required for the MAIN‑world content script).

<details>
<summary><b>🧑‍💻 Load unpacked (for developers)</b></summary>

1. **Download the latest release ZIP** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Gythiro/yt-dual-subs/releases/latest) and unzip it. *(Prefer the command line? `git clone` works too.)*
1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
1. Turn on **Developer mode** (top‑right).
1. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder.
1. Open a YouTube video with captions — the subtitles appear automatically.

> ⚠️ **Getting "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"?** This almost always means the archive was extracted into a **nested folder** (`yt-dual-subs\yt-dual-subs\`). Keep opening the folder until you see `manifest.json` directly inside, and select *that* level. Prefer the ZIP from the **Releases page** (it unzips to a single folder) over the green **Code** button's source download, and make sure you actually **extracted** the ZIP rather than loading from inside the archive.

</details>

## 🌐 Official Website

**[gythiro.github.io/yt-dual-subs](https://gythiro.github.io/yt-dual-subs/)** — the extension's home page, in **English and 中文**: a visual tour of the features, install links, and the latest updates, all on one page. If you're sending this extension to a friend, send them there.

## ⚙️ Usage

- **Toolbar icon** → settings popup: target language, translation engine, line order, position, spacing, and per‑line styling — all with a live preview.
- **Gear icon** (top-right of the popup) → the settings page: getting started, translation-service setup for your own key, and which languages appear in the menu.
- **Control‑bar button** (the caption icon next to the gear): one‑click on/off. Blue = on, grey = off.
- **Drag** the subtitle box by its handle (appears top‑left when you hover the player); **double‑click** the handle to reset its position.
- **Export** (popup → *Export*): download the subtitles as an `.srt` file — choose original, translation, or bilingual.

## 📖 The fine print

<details>
<summary><b>🔬 How it works</b></summary>

YouTube serves caption tracks from an `/api/timedtext` endpoint that now requires a per‑request **proof‑of‑origin token** (`pot`). An extension can't just fetch a track URL on its own — it gets an empty response. So instead:

1. A MAIN‑world script (`inject.js`) passively watches the page (XHR, `fetch`, and Resource Timing) and captures the **player's own** timedtext request, which already carries a valid `pot`.
1. It re‑fetches that exact URL as `json3` for the original cues, and again with `&tlang=` for YouTube's translation — aligned cue‑for‑cue.
1. `content.js` drives an overlay off `video.currentTime`, showing the right sentence and its translation at the right moment, and hides YouTube's native caption layer so there's a single, non‑overlapping line set.
1. If the cue fetch ever fails, it falls back to reading the on‑screen caption text directly.

<details>
<summary><b>🔁 Translation engines compared</b></summary>

The default **Auto** mode uses Whole‑track whenever the video's track can be translated, and switches to Smart sentences when it can't. Either engine can also be pinned manually in the popup — Smart sentences is worth a try when the whole‑track wording reads badly. A third path, off by default, sends each sentence to a provider you supply a key for; the table below compares the two free engines.

| | Whole‑track (YouTube) | Smart sentences (Google) |
|---|---|---|
| Source | YouTube's own server‑side track translation | Google Translate's free endpoint |
| How | Translates the whole track server‑side — perfectly aligned, cue for cue | **Rebuilds full sentences** from the caption fragments first, then translates whole sentences |
| Best for | Most videos — the default | Tracks YouTube can't translate, or fragmented auto‑captions whose whole‑track wording reads badly |
| Note | Quality varies with how YouTube segments the track | Unofficial endpoint — heavy use may be briefly rate‑limited; the extension paces itself and retries on its own |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⏳ Translations occasionally pause?</b></summary>

The Smart‑sentences engine uses Google's free public endpoint. Under heavy use — long videos, lots of seeking — it may briefly rate‑limit your IP. The extension notices, slows down, and retries on its own: the translation line shows "…" while it waits, and translations resume automatically, usually within seconds to a couple of minutes. Already‑translated sentences stay cached. If the video supports it, pinning **Whole‑track (YouTube)** in the popup avoids the free endpoint entirely — though YouTube's own translation can be briefly limited too, in which case the extension waits and asks again. The same applies to a bilingual SRT export, which is built from that whole‑track translation: if it is limited, the export says so; exporting **Original** always works, and an own‑key export goes through your provider instead.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚠️ Limitations</b></summary>

- Needs a real caption track. **Burned‑in** subtitles (baked into the video pixels) can't be hidden — use the control‑bar toggle to switch the overlay off for those videos.
- The Smart‑sentences engine uses an unofficial Google endpoint with no SLA; heavy use may be briefly rate‑limited (the extension backs off and recovers on its own).
- Depends on YouTube's current behaviour; a major YouTube change may require a selector update.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🛠 Development</b></summary>

Plain vanilla JS/CSS — no build step, no dependencies.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `inject.js` | MAIN‑world sniffer: captures the player's pot‑bearing timedtext URL, fetches cues + translation |
| `content.js` | Overlay, cue engine, drag, control‑bar toggle, rendered‑scrape fallback |
| `background.js` | Translation service worker — three lanes: YouTube whole‑track, Google's free endpoint, and your own provider |
| `popup.html/.css/.js` | Settings UI with live preview |
| `options.html/.js` | Settings page: getting started, provider setup, language management, about |
| `providers.js` | The provider table — endpoints, default models, per‑provider quirks |
| `languages.js` | The target-language table (the count the UI shows is derived from it) |
| `content.css` | Overlay styling + native‑caption suppression |

## 🔒 Privacy

No analytics, no tracking, no accounts. Caption text is sent **only** to the translation service you choose. Settings are stored in `chrome.storage.sync`; an API key you supply is stored in `chrome.storage.local` on that machine, never synced, and sent only as the authorization header of requests to the endpoint you picked. Full policy: [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).
